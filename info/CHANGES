*Found a slightly better audio track

#TEST010#
*Started moving things to config file (config.sec)
*Changed titles and stuff to something more general
*Added a delay in the main loop to help control cpu useage, but this is a bandaid at best.
 Uses about 30% of one of two cores on my Pentium D and 35-40mb of ram.
*Capped FPS at 20. It's a VN, it doesn't need any more at the moment. Can be changed in config.sec
*You can now use Japanese in stories if you have an apropriate font(s).

#TEST011#
*Added more config options
*Changed how intro screen runs
*Changed intro screen
*Reorganized main loop some. Should help CPU use a bit.
*Added VideoPlay and AudioStart function. Should be easy to figure out what they do.
*Removed some redundant strings.
*Changed main screen title font to something that renders better on Windows.
*Removed TextRenderMainScreen and merged it with just the regular TextRender
&Credits do not run at a stable FPS and I'm not sure why yet.
&The menu screen needs to be totaly redone in order to make buttons
 clickable. It was an afterthought at best and isen't funtional.
&Game still spikes CPU usage sometimes. I think it has to do with how
 images are being loaded. CPU spiking is worse on Linux.
 
#TEST012#
*Update readme
*Added license
*Intro can only ever be played once now, it can't be called again.
*Removed/Made comments in source more readible.
*Reorginized code so it's more readible.
*Added BGload/CharLoad funtion.
*Sound control setting added to config.sec
*After a ton of work CPU useage has been fully addressed! The game runs stable
 using under 10% of my CPU (2.13Ghz C2D P7450) 90% of the time under Windows.
 This is much better than the 30% average (with spikes to 60%) from before.
*Intro and credits run at a more stable speed now with fewer dropped frames.
*Removed time import as it's no longer needed

#TEST013#
*Added debug mode. Enable in dat/config.sec. Here is a list of debug info:
	CS = Current Scene
	CC = Current Character
	DN = Sees if the game has been told to go to credits. If you see True in game something is wrong.
	DM = Shows if Devmode is enabled or not
	AP = 0 if audio is not playing, 1 if it is.
	AM = Shows if audio is paused or not
	AL = Returns current volume
 Debug into does not show during the intro or credits. Only while playing and
 on the main menu.
 
#TEST014#
*Cleaned up variables so they all follow the same naming convention
*Cleaned up comments and fixed any spelling mistakes.
*Added option to run VN full screen or windowed. 

#TEST015#

*Fixed bug where menu wouldn't load after credits,
*Fixed bug where game wouldn't load after returning to the menu onces
*Fixed bug where main menu buttons wouldn't work after returning to main menu from game
*Disabled advancing by mouse click. There's an issue with this right now, it'll be fixed soon.
&The code that keep the menu from using a lot of CPU has been disabled for now. It was causing issues.
 The story in game still runs fine in the regard. I need to redo the code for the main menu soon.
 
##TEST017##
*Moved UI placement settings to conf.py, along with a few other settings we don't want users changing.
*Set some variables as global in order to make the code cleaner
*Changed ingame UI buttons
*Changed main menu hover animation.
&Noticed a bug when returning to the main menu. If you press play after being in game the engine will crash.

##TEST018##
*Fixed bug previously mentioned where pressing play after returning to main menu would crash game.
*Info button actually does something now. (Opens webpage to git repo)
*Fixed bug with error logging

##TEST019##
*Working on making the game run widescreen.
*Relocated *almost* all configuration data to conf.py. This is a large change, something will be broken as a result
 I just have yet to find it.
*Fixed save loding. When clicked the load button would act like play button. This was because two varibles were
 not declaried global.

##TEST020##
*Update UI
*Once again fix the save system. It's junk and needs to be replaced, but for now once again works.
*Start adding mini chars by text.
*Added pygame._view to imports. This is not really needed if you plan to just run the .py file, but there's an issue
 with things like py2exe and pyinstaller where you won't get a working executible without this line. It's annoying, but 
 this line ensures that won't be an issue.
 
##TEST021##
*Removed TransRect function as it's no longer used.

KNOWN ISSUES...
*Segmentation fault on Core 2 Duo Macs running Linux with Intel Integrated Graphics when trying to play videos is likely.
 Confirmed to affect the mid-2007 Mac Mini (macmini2,1). Likely also affects Macbooks from the same time. May be an issue
 on Mac OS X as well, but is unconfirmed.
