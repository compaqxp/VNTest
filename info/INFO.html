<h2>Test 0.20</h2>

<p>This is a test piece of software. If it crashes your computer or corrupts a file
it's your own fault. I can not and will not be held responsible for such things.</p>

<p>The goal of this software is to create a simple VN engine using Python and the
Pygame library. It's very basic and should not be used for any serious projects.</p>

<p>All story data is stored in JSON files. All user options can be found in dat/config.sec
and all non-user changable options can be found in conf.py </p>

<h3>Controls:</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Right Arrow</b> - Advance Story<br></li>
<li><b>Left Arrow</b> - Move back in story<br></li>
<li><b>M</b> - Toggle music on or off<br></li>
<li><b>S</b> - Saves while in game<br></li>
<li><b>Q</b> - Quit (No confirmation, just quits immediately)<br></li>
<li><b>ESC</b> - Return to main menu (Play button to go back to game)</li></ul>
</p>


<h3>Config.sec parameters:</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li><b>gamefps:</b> Accepts an int, is set to 30 by default. I wouldn't set it above 60 though.<br></li>
<li><b>videofps:</b> Accepts an int, is the FPS the intro and credits/other videos will run at. I'v found using the videos native FPS*2 makes it play smooth.</li>
<li><b>volume:</b> A number from 0.0 to 1.0. Default is 0.2. Changes in game volume.<br></li>
</ul></p>


<h3>conf.py:</h3>

<p>conf.py houses settings that we don't want the end user messing with. Once built conf.py gets included in the resulting executable file.

There are comments in conf.py describing what each of the settings do. It would be wise
to keep a backup of this file while working in case you mess something up in it.</p>

<h3>build_win.py</h3>

<p>Used for building the VN on Windows OSs. You should be running Python 2.7 and have
the latest version of Py2Exe installed in order to use it.

It's important to note this do *not* build an executable for any non-Windows OS.</p>

<h3>Debug mode abbreviations:</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li><b>CS =</b> Current Scene<br></li>
<li><b>CC =</b> Current Character<br></li>
<li><b>DN =</b> Sees if the game has been told to go to credits. If you see True in game something is wrong.<br></li>
<li><b>DM =</b> Shows if Devmode is enabled or not<br></li>
<li><b>AP =</b> 0 if audio is not playing, 1 if it is.<br></li>
<li><b>AM =</b> Shows if audio is paused or not<br></li>
<li><b>AL =</b> Returns current volume</li>
</ul></p>
